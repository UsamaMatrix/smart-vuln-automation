## 🔍 Overview

**Smart Vulnerability Automation (SVA)** is an **AI-powered vulnerability scanning and exploitation framework**, built for rapid and intelligent security assessments.  
It integrates well-known tools like **Nuclei, sqlmap, and FFUF**, wrapped within a smart controller that optimizes scanning speed and reduces false positives.

This framework automates the entire process of:

- Asset discovery
- Vulnerability scanning
- Exploit validation
- Report generation

Designed for **penetration testers and red teams** conducting **large-scale assessments.**

## ⚙️ Key Features

- 🔎 **Automated Asset Discovery:** DNS, Subdomain, and Port Scanning.
- ⚡ **Parallelized Vulnerability Scanning:** Using Nuclei, FFUF, and custom-built AI modules.
- 🎯 **Smart Exploitation Engine:** Integrates sqlmap and custom fuzzers to exploit detected vulnerabilities.
- 📑 **Auto Report Generation:** HTML, CSV, and JSON reports with severity rankings.
- 🧠 **AI Assistance:** Prioritizes findings based on real-world exploitability patterns.

## 🛡️ Use Cases

| Scenario                          | Description                                           |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Nuclei (for HTTP vulnerabilities)
- sqlmap (for SQL injection testing)
- FFUF (for fuzzing)
- AI/ML libraries (custom vulnerability prioritization)
- Dockerized microservices

## 🚫 Why Code is Confidential?

This project includes **custom automation around security tools**, AI prioritization logic, and **exploitation workflows**.  
To avoid misuse, the code is available only for authorized security professionals during engagements.
